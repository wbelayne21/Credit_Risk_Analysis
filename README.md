# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to train and compare different machine learning models that help predict credit risk. The data is imbalanced as there are far more low-risk loan status than high risk. We would use Random Over Sampler and SMOTE to oversample, Cluster Centroids to undersample and SMOTEENN to combine over- and undersamples. We also used two machine learning models Balanced Random Forest Classifier and Easy Ensemble Classifier to reduce bias as we predict credit risk.
